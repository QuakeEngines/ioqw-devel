# Ioid3-qw 

**A second breath of life for Xreal, based on Zack Middleton's ioq3ztm engine**

Ioid3-qw is currently based on ioq3ztm and also contains code from [Spearmint](https://clover.moe/spearmint/) (the successor of ioq3ztm), and code from other repositories owned by [Zack Middleton](https://github.com/zturtleman?tab=repositories).


## License:

Ioid3-qw is licensed under a [modified version of the GNU GPLv3](COPYING.txt#L625) (or at your option, any later version). The license is also used by Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, and Doom 3.


## Main features:

  * K&R (aka 1TBS/OTBS) formatted code.
  * Enhanced BotAI.
  * Rotating gibs.
  * Slightly faster maths.

## Main features from Spearmint:

  * Aspect correct widescreen.
  * High resolution font support (TrueType).
  * Enhanced model loading (incl. sub-models).
  * Dynamic skin support.
  * Bullet marks on doors and moving platforms.
  * Gibs and bullet shells ride on moving platforms.
  * New shader keywords and game objects.
  * Foliage support.
  * Better external lightmap support.
  * Atmospheric effects, like rain and snow.
  * Dynamic lights have smoother edges.
  * Improved Bot AI.

## Goals:

  * Ragdoll physics.
  * Realtime lightning/shadowing.
  * 64 weapon support.
  * Even more improved Bot AI.
  * Advanced bot order menu.


## Current differences to Spearmint:

  * Splitscreen support is still missing due to some rendering issues.
  * Spearmint's gamepad/joystck support is missing.
  * Lot of bot AI code is still compiled into the engine, like it was by default.
  * The default code sctructure is kept alive, engine and game modules aren't seperated, so Ioid3-qw is less modding friendly.
